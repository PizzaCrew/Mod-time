# What a cool repo wow

IntelliJ start
1. Open IDEA, and import project.
2. Select your build.gradle file and have it import.
3. Run the following command: `gradlew genIntellijRuns` (`./gradlew genIntellijRuns` if you are on Mac/Linux)
4. Refresh the Gradle Project in IDEA if required.

If at any point you are missing libraries in your IDE, or you've run into problems you can 
run `gradlew --refresh-dependencies` to refresh the local cache. `gradlew clean` to reset everything 
{this does not affect your code} and then start the process again.
